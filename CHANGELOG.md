# Changelog

This file records notable user-facing and maintainer-facing changes to
Dolgorae. Releases receive a version and date only when the repository has
corresponding release authority; historical releases are not inferred from
development commits.

## v0.1.1 - Unreleased

### Changed

- Moved all per-user configuration and mutable authority to the fixed
  `~/.dolgorae` root.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-08-30

### Added

- Established portable Git and explicit non-Git workspaces with durable local
  identity, permission-safe state, and machine-readable command envelopes.
- Added persistent Codex app-server profiles, worker and controller authority,
  durable Run lifecycle commands, reconnectable event history, recovery, and
  audit records.
- Added isolated one-shot specialist review with bounded structured findings
  and explicit failure, timeout, and settlement behavior.
- Added immutable workspace, staged, dirty, HEAD, commit, and range review
  targets with safety checks, source-drift detection, and idempotent settlement.

### Changed

- Migrated canonical documentation into explicit single-scope role directories
  and established the missing implementation, operations, TODO, and deferred
  feedback owners.
